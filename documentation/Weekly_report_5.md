## What have you done this week? // General?
I'm fully aware of the fact that I didn't get much done this week. 
Realistically I probably shouldn't have even taken this course in this period as I simply don't have time to really put much effort into it. 
But I feel I'm far too far into the course at this point and I'm just hoping to end up with a somewhat decent project at the end of it.

What I did this week was do the peer review, which was very difficult as the work I was trying to "review" was far more advanced in both style and in the time spent on it. 
I could barely find anything wrong with it, while my work is riddled with mistakes and things to be changed. 
Seeing the difference in hours spent on the projects was truly a humbling experience to say the least.
Still I also read the peer review for my project (which were far too kind) and spent some time thinking about those. 
I didn't really work on any of the major tips yet, but I did look into them (though refactoring is something I'm well aware I should do)

Then I generally tried to work even a little on the project with the time I had, but honestly, it's barely anything. 
I more-so know what I should do next and spent time thinking about that, than I actually got things done.

## How has the project progressed?
Continued with AI tests, but still doesn't make that much sense to work on them as my algorithm is quite slow.
Added set grid to more easily do tests on AI without always starting from 0.

## What did you learn this week?
Regarding my own work not much, but I did pick up on some things from the peer review I did. (For example I didn't even know you could have a moving ui like that in the terminal"

## What has been unclear or problematic? Please answer this question truthfully, as this is something the course assistant may be able to help with.
Nothing really, mainly me being the problem.

## What next?
Edit/clean code
Work on AI
Generally hopefully have more time next week! (Not likely)

## Hours spent
7 hours
