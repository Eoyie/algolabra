## What have you done this week? // General?

I "think" I might have fixed the algorithm finally? Or at least it's working a lot better as it used to achieve around 17k score and now 40k-60k. 
Though if there is still something wrong with it I actually do have time at the start of the week to maybe work it out in zoom even though I'd definitely prefer not to!

I found the tiny mistake which was letting the algorithm still "work", but not properly while I was implementing minimax. 
I decided to do so as I thought it would be interesting to see if I could get that to work properly. 
It's still visible in the minimax code where I realised my mistake in the Computer player part, as I stopped working on minimax and then moved on to doing manual tests on Expectiminimax.
I still decided to keep what I had started on with minimax as I'll try to finish it if I have time.
To perhaps do some comparisons as from what I understood minimax doesn't even always reach 2048, while everytime I tested the now "working" Expectiminimax I never got under 4048.

## How has the project progressed?
- Expectiminimax works? At least better than it used to!
- Started a little bit on minimax
- Improved game end prints
- Got some manual testing data done
- Cleaned a little bit of code for pylint

## What did you learn this week?
Well I learned some more about minimax and more so understood the similarities with minimax and expectiminimax.

## What has been unclear or problematic? Please answer this question truthfully, as this is something the course assistant may be able to help with.
Well I was a little stressed out about the demo session times for some time as I have both work and exams on that week, but I ended up finding the link to pick times and 2 days worked for me so all is good now.

## What next?
- Edit/clean code more?
- Work on AI (Expectiminimax if it doesn't actually work and if it does work on minimax if I have time! Might moreso be for my own interest than for example the demo session)
- Do more manual testing and add smaller tests
- Generally finish the project and documentation as this is the last week report.
