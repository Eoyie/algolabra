## What have you done this week? // General?

I "think" I might have fixed the algorithm finally? Or at least it's working a lot better as it used to achieve around 17k score and now 40k-60k. 
Though if there is still something wrong with it I actually do have time at the start of the week to maybe work it out in zoom even though I'd definitely prefer not to!

I found the tiny mistake which was letting the algorithm still "work", but not properly while I was implementing minimax. 
I decided to do so as I thought it would be interesting to see if I could get that to work properly. 
It's still visible in the minimax code where I realised my mistake in the Computer player part, as I stopped working on minimax and then moved on to doing manual tests on Expectiminimax.
I still decided to keep what I had started on with minimax as I'll try to finish it if I have time.
To perhaps do some comparisons as from what I understood minimax doesn't even always reach 2048, while everytime I tested the now "working" Expectiminimax I never got under 4048.

## Some questions for final deadline
- Is it okay to have the user guide in the README or should I make it it's own document?
- Is the amount of automatic testing I have for the ai ok? Should I do more automatic tests or can I focus on manual? And for manual testing should I make "automatic" tests that run the game to completion for given amount times and returns the gotten scores? Or is it fine to do them completely manually. I'm asking this from a points point of view and might do more tests/the automatic test even though it's not "required".
- Is adding minimax to the mix not good in terms of the course? By this I mean am I supposed to only focus on one algorithm? I'd like to work on it if I have time, but am I generally expected to do the testing etc. on just one algoritm and should I then just implement minimax after the course for my own fun. Will I lose points if I have a not-as-tested 2nd algorithm alongside the main one aka if I implement minimax do I have to have the same amount of documentation on it?

## How has the project progressed?
- Expectiminimax works? At least better than it used to!
- Started a little bit on minimax
- Improved game end prints
- Got some manual testing data done
- Cleaned a little bit of code for pylint

## What did you learn this week?
Well I learned some more about minimax and more so understood the similarities with minimax and expectiminimax.

## What has been unclear or problematic? Please answer this question truthfully, as this is something the course assistant may be able to help with.
Well I was a little stressed out about the demo session times for some time as I have both work and exams on that week, but I ended up finding the link to pick times and 2 days worked for me so all is good now.

## What next?
- Edit/clean code more?
- Work on AI (Expectiminimax if it doesn't actually work and if it does work on minimax if I have time! Might moreso be for my own interest than for example the demo session)
- Do more manual testing and add smaller tests
- Generally finish the project and documentation as this is the last week report.
