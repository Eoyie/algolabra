## What have you done this week? // General?
I got the expectiminimax algorithm to work properly (but slowly) and made a very basic pygame view for the game. I also did research testing a bit, but I didn't really start anything major yet (I couldn't make it to the lecture on the subject because of work so not sure if that might have helped as well) Also started on the implementation document, but I didn't feel I was really ready to properly start on either one of them.

I did spend most time on the algorithm (probably 2nd most on the UI) as in the middle I tried changing to minimax, but it didn't work out either, and eventually fixed my little mistakes. I noticed the feedback on labtool about Telegram quite late in the week and didn't really want help that late if I didn't have to. Generally, I think my work progressed once again not that well, but at a better pace perhaps. Not leaving everything to the very last minute, though this is only because of work outside of university.

I do think I should find a way to spend more time on this project, but my future work shifts aren't looking like that'll happen so I'm generally going for good/passing. I think perhaps a lot of the harder stuff is out of the way. And I might have time to fix/optimize some things that bother me currently

## How has the project progressed?
- Expectiminimax to my knowledge works fine, but slowly
- UI created, but hopefully not final
- Started on some AI tests, but generally not much

## What did you learn this week?
I got much more familiar with Expectiminimax and minimax etc. Having spent time choosing between the two and trying to fix my own mistakes. Generally I feel like I understood/understand them both well now, but I couldn't always understand what was wrong in the code (simple mistakes that become quite hard to detect because of my dyslexia). But I ended up finding them and also understanding the algorithm better.

## What has been unclear or problematic? Please answer this question truthfully, as this is something the course assistant may be able to help with.
Nothing really, but hopefully it was ok for me to not be in touch through Telegram, I'd prefer not to unless something is very wrong!

## What next?
- Edit/clean code
- Tests for AI (not sure how yet)
  
## Time spent
9 hours
