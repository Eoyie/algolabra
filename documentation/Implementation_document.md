# Implementation
## The general structure of the program

### Game Manager
- Grid:
  - New Grid
  - Set Grid
  - Check Valid Grid
- Tiles:
  - Add Game Tile
  - Get Free Tiles
- Move
- Check Game End

### Game UI
- Start
- Run Game
- Take Input
- Draw Board
  
### AI
- Heuristic Evaluation
- Next Move
- Expectiminimax
  
Todo:
Add class picture? Either change completely to a text-based explanation or keep bullet points, but add all the needed info.

## The time and space complexities achieved (e.g., Big O analyses from pseudocode).
### Potentially, performance and Big O analysis comparison (if applicable to the topic).
Need to double check. Otherwise same as mentioned in project specification?

## Shortcomings
To see, but might generally actually work now? If so will add to this later.
## Use of extensive language models
None
