# Implementation
## The general structure of the program

### Game Manager
- Grid:
  - New Grid: Creates a starting grid
  - Set Grid: Sets a given custom grid
  - Check Valid Grid: Check validity of custom grid
- Tiles:
  - Add Game Tile: Adds 2 or 4 tiles or a given custom tiles to a given position
  - Get Free Tiles: Returns all blank tiles
- Move & move checks: Moves the grid in given direction based on various checks
- Check Game End

### Game UI
- Ask Grid: Asks if the player wants to use a custom grid or not
- Start: If a valid or default grid moves to the game loop
- Run Game: Game loop
- Take Input: Takes inputs of arrow keys, space and closing
- Draw Board: Updates the pygame visible board
- End Game: Prints the reached biggest tile and score
  
### AI
- Heuristic Evaluation: Snake heuristic evaluation of given board
- Next Move: Gets next best move by the help of Expectiminimax
- Expectiminimax

## The time and space complexities achieved
I remain to be uncertain of these, so estimates in the project estimation are the closest I have to an answer.

## Shortcomings
- AI sometimes frozes when almost full
- AI doesn't check for 4 tiles
## Use of extensive language models
None
