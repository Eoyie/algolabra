## The general structure of the program
Todo:
Add picture?
## The time and space complexities achieved (e.g., Big O analyses from pseudocode).
### Potentially, performance and Big O analysis comparison (if applicable to the topic).
Need to double check. Otherwise same as mentioned in project specification?
## Shortcomings
Many:
- Currently slow AI (might change)
- 
## Use of extensive language models
None
