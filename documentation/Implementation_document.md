# Implementation
## The general structure of the program

### Game Manager
- Grid:
  - New Grid
  - Set Grid
  - Check Valid Grid
- Tiles:
  - Add Game Tile
  - Get Free Tiles
- Move & move checks
- Check Game End

### Game UI
- Start
- Run Game
- Take Input
- Draw Board
- End Game
  
### AI
- Heuristic Evaluation
- Next Move
- Expectiminimax


## The time and space complexities achieved
I remain to be uncertain of these, so estimates in the project estimation are the closest I have to an asnwer.

## Shortcomings
- AI sometimes frozes when almost full
- AI doesn't check for 4 tiles
## Use of extensive language models
None
