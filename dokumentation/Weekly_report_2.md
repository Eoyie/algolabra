## What have you done this week?
I started on the project, researched and hopefully got the necessary goals done. 
I spent some time before and after doing the main code for this week on trying to get Github actions to work as I haven't used them before.
Had some troubles with Codecov, but generally it seems to work now (After many tries).

I also debated on what to work on first with the project, especially because I had a little less time to work on the project this week.
Ultimately decided to make a very basic base that I could easily continue to work on next week, when I should have more time for it.
I did at the same time also try out and research the proper way to build and run the game, but none of that code is currently pushed as it doesn't actually work yet.
But I'm very sure of what to do next.

## How has the project progressed?
As mentioned there is a base for everything, but a lot of the current code will probably be deleted and updated at some point.
Current state:
- Prints instructions
- Generates 4x4 grid with one randomly placed 2 tile
- Can only move said one 2 tile with wasd commands
  - No new tiles will spawn yet, as I have to completely update the moving methods first to fit combining tiles.

## What did you learn this week?
All my code is currently very basic so I more so learned about the github side of things. 
Getting Codecov to work was new to me and not having ready examples for every step of creating a project (poetry, pylint etc.) also made me re-learn those things.

## What has been unclear or problematic? Please answer this question truthfully, as this is something the course assistant may be able to help with.
I had little bit of difficulty on understanding how much code I should have done by this week.
I think the amount I've done is maybe a little less than was planned, but probably still enough to not effect points.

## What next?
1. Change moving the tiles to actual needed methods (from my general research flipping, transposing, merging etc.)
2. Add game stages.
3. Maybe divide game and logic.
4. (Tkinkter?)
5. Might still keep adding 2's just random or start a little on a less random option.

## Time spent
8 hours
