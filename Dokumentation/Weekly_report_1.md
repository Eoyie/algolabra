### What have you done this week?
I've made myself familiar with the course contents and schedule. I have also chosen my topic for the project and done some necessary research on the basics of the topic for the project specification documentation.

I did spend some time researching another (Dungeon Generator) topic than the one I chose (2048) and wrote some of the project specifications for that topic before deciding to change my topic after seeing the "Contact the course assistant early if this topic interests you." part which was only in the English version of the "ideas for project topics". 
Generally, it scared me a little as I'm not a very experienced coder and I felt that maybe 2048 would be a safer option in my case.
Though I do wonder why it was only in the English version of the page.
I do think 2048 will definitely still be a challenge for me as the whole expectiminimax/minimax part is already confusing, but hopefully more doable with my skillset.
### How has the project progressed?
- The topic has been chosen and some research has been done
- The repository has been created
- The project specification has been created
### What did you learn this week / today?
I learned some base information about the algorithms I'll be working with, but I still need to research them a lot more.
I do think I'll only properly learn about them once I start working on the project itself.
### What has been unclear or problematic? Please answer this question truthfully, as this is something the course assistant may be able to help with.
I spent a lot of time being confused over NetBeans as I had never heard of it and it was just quickly mentioned in the GitHub tutorial (After going over this week's schedule I did find more information about it from one of the links, which kind of has made me more confused as it's yet another git tutorial?), which I almost didn't even read as I've made repositories before. 
It just felt like it was some common knowledge that I should've known about as some other things I've used like unittests had links to their tutorials. I'm still very confused over it and chose to just ignore it as I wasn't really sure if I was really meant to use it or if it was just for Java?

Also generally struggled with making the project specification as I wasn't sure if it was meant to be more official or if was I allowed to mention things I wasn't sure of. 
I hope what I ended up going with is somewhat acceptable.
### What next?
Hopefully start the actual project.

### Time spent: 
5 hours
