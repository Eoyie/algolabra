## Coding language
I will be using Python as it is generally the only coding language I am familiar with, 
having used it for all courses and projects in University so far. 
I do not think I'll be able to properly do code reviews on projects written in a different language.

## Data structures and algorithms

## What problem are you solving and why did you chose these specific data structures and algorithms
## What is the program input and how will it be used
## Expected time and space complexities of the program (big-O notations)
## Sources
## My degree programme
Bachelorâ€™s in computer science (CS)
## Documentation language
Even though I am a Finnish speaker, I have chosen to use English for this course.
